<div class='content'><p>Inbound Marketing is a methodology that focuses on attracting customers through relevant and useful content, adding value at every stage of the buyer's journey. Unlike traditional marketing, which interrupts consumers with unwanted ads, Inbound Marketing seeks to attract potential customers organically.</p>
</div><h1>Origins of Inbound Marketing</h1>
<div class='content'><p>The term &quot;Inbound Marketing&quot; was coined by Brian Halligan, co-founder of HubSpot, in 2005. However, the principles behind this methodology have deeper roots:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content Marketing</strong>: Since the early days of advertising, brands have used content to attract and educate their audiences. An early example is John Deere's &quot;The Furrow&quot; magazine, launched in 1895 to provide useful information to farmers.</li>
<li><strong>SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</strong>: With the advent of search engines in the 90s, companies began optimizing their websites to appear in search results, marking the beginning of SEO strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Blogs and Social Media</strong>: In the early 2000s, blogs and social media began to gain popularity, providing new platforms for companies to share content and connect with their audiences.</li>
</ul>
